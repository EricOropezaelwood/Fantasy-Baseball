    "1. Introduction - A summary of your general approach\n",
    "2. Data and statistics - Describe the data and statistics that you used, and how they were used.\n",
    "3. Results of your approach - This section needs to include the top 5 players that your approach identifies. You also need to select one player from your top 5 and provide an analysis of his rating and monetary value.\n",
    "4. Limitations - What difficulties do you see with implementing your strategy in the draft?\n",

    "Looking at one of our outfielders, **Nick Markakis** -  He earned a 'fantasy' score of 5534 and has a very low salary as compared to other cathcers. He had 623 AB with a BA of .297 for the 2018 season. He also hit 185 R, 43 doubles, 2 triples, and 14 HR during this season as well. This is the type of player who will allow us to rack up a lot of points for our fantasy league while still being a reasonably priced player.\n"

The same goes for our pitchers where we are only assessing on salary, IP, K, BB, HBP, and HR. There are other ways to earn points in Fantasy but we have decided these areas will give us the biggest bang for our buck. However, this may come to hurt us in the long run as we will most likely be under our budget. "
